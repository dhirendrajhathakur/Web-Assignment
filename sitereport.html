            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                This site report documents my experience of learning the basics of web development
                during this module. Building this portfolio website helped me understand how HTML
                and CSS work together to create structured and visually appealing web pages. At the
                beginning of the term, I had limited experience in web design, but through weekly
                practice I became more confident in writing clean and organised code.

            <h2>Learning Experience (Ups and Downs)</h2>
            <p>
                One of the biggest challenges I faced was debugging errors such as missing tags,
                incorrect file paths, and CSS rules not applying correctly. These issues were
                frustrating at first, but they helped me understand the importance of validation
                and attention to detail. Over time, my confidence increased and I began to enjoy
                experimenting with layouts and colours.

            <h2>Development of the Website</h2>
            <p>
                Over the term, the website developed from a simple single page into a multi-page
                portfolio including a home page, projects page, contact page, video demonstration
                page, and this site report. Each page follows a consistent structure and navigation
                menu to ensure good usability.

        <section>
            <h2>Design and User Interface Decisions</h2>
            <p>
                A blue and white colour scheme was chosen to create a clean and professional
                appearance. A simple sans-serif font was used to improve readability across
                different devices. The navigation menu is horizontal and consistent on all pages,
                making it easy for users to move through the website.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Validation and Responsiveness</h2>
            <p>
                All HTML and CSS files were validated using the W3C validation tools. Screenshots of
                the validation results are included below to demonstrate that the code follows web
                standards. The website is responsive and works on both desktop and mobile devices.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                This module has provided me with a strong foundation in web development. The skills
                I gained in HTML, CSS, design, and debugging will be valuable for future academic
                and professional projects. Overall, the experience was challenging but rewarding.
